Each project has a unique style to analyze depending on data.
<h1>There are some steps I use it in General: </h1> 
<ul>
 <li> First, I like to take a copy of the raw data as a backup.
<li> then starting the cleaning and gathering process including removing duplicates, removing empty rows, Check the spelling, removing extra spaces, adapt the formatting, .... etc.
<li> Through cleaning and gathering process I am exploring and navigating the data, detect patterns and relationships, add calculation columns, then ask questions that will help me and the final users to understand the data.
<li> After that starting the analyzing process usually with pivot tables "it's a great tool" and trying to answer the questions 
<li> Finally, designing the dashboard, it is important to make it dynamic or interactive as possible so usually use slicers and timelines.
</ul>
 That was the general steps that I usually follow.

I will be glad if you give me your opinion and I am open to hearing criticism.
