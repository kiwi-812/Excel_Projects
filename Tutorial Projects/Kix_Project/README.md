# Kix Project
This is the longest tutorial that I have flown. It is concentrating on visualization, designing the dashboard, and analyzing data using the power query and the power pivot.
## These are the links to the tutorial:

<ul>
<li> At first, we took an overview about the data.
<li> Then we start the cleaning process:
  <ul>
<li> removing duplicates. 
<li> declare the abbreviations.
<li> adapt the formatting.
<li> merging columns.
<li> adding custom columns.
<li> add a dimensional table for the date

  </ul>
<li> gathering process:<br>
          “In this project we use power pivot through this process”<br>
Through this process we will create connections between dimensional tables and the fact table, then create our measures like “Total profit, Total revenue……. etc.”
<li> After that we start the analyzing process:
  <ul>
   <li> answering the questions:<br>
 “You could find these questions in row data as a pdf file.”
 <li> trying to answer these questions through the analyzing process using pivot tables:<br>
 
   
  </ul>
   

<li> Visualization process starts here we trying to find the suitable way to visualize the data:<br>
“In this project we used an add-in called Zebra BI for office to visualize the difference between the target and the actual revenue, we used macros to create the filter bottom and also we used text join formula to create a dynamic title.”
<li> Finally designing dynamic a dashboard with slicers and timeline.
