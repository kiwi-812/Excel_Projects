In this project we have two files one of them I flows the tutorial way through gathering process with formulas, the other one I used the power pivot to create connections between the tables.
<ul>
<li> At first, we took an overview of the data.
<li> Then we start the cleaning process:
<ul><li> removing duplicates. 
<li> declare the abbreviations.
<li> adapt the formatting.
<li> add a column to calculate the revenue.
  </ul>
<li> gathering process:
<ul><li> with formulas like (index and match, Xlookup, ifs).
<li>  in a different way with power pivot.
  </ul>
<li> After that we start the analyzing process:
<ul><li> asking questions. “You could find a sheet for these questions into the project.”
<li> trying to answer these questions through the analyzing process using pivot tables.</ul>
<li> Visualization process starts here we trying to find the suitable way to visualize the data.
<li> Finally designing dynamic a dashboard with slicers and timeline.
