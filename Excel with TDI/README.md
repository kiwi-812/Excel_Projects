In this folder, you will find all excel projects that I did throughout my journey to learn about data analytics with [TDI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thedata-initiative-tdi/mycompany/). In each project or workbook, you could find almost three sheets one for row dataset another one for calculations other one for analysis or dashboard you could find more details about each week assignment on my linked in profile.
